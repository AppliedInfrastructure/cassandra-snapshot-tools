# How to Contribute
The goal of Cassandra Snapshot Tools is to provide a simple and intuitive way to leverage Cassandra snapshots that "just works".  I hope you find this true of the project today and in future releases.

Everyone's contributions are welcome.  In the current form, Cassandra Snapshot Tools is a set of Bash shell scripts that leverage standard Cassandra utilities like `nodetool`, `cqlsh`, and `sstableloader`, but should always aim to be simple, reliable, and intuitive.  Please keep this in mind as you submit enhancement requests or pull requests, but don't hesitate to submit an issue if something doesn't work in a simple, reliable, or intuitive way.
