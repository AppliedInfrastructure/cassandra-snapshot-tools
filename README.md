# Cassandra Snapshot Tools [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AppliedInfrastructure/cassandra-snapshot-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AppliedInfrastructure/cassandra-snapshot-tools)
A handy couple of scripts that make creating, moving, and restoring SSTable snapshots between clusters easy.  Some common use cases include:
* Copying keyspaces between clusters (QA environments, for example)
* Staging an upgrade (application, Cassandra, both) using a copy of live data
* Seeding data in a test environment
* Snapshotting a keyspace for offline analytics
* Backup and restore
* Generally moving a keyspace from one Cassandra cluster to another

Cassandra Snapshot Tools currently includes two BASH shell scripts, `getSnapshot` and `putSnapshot`, which leverage standard Cassandra utilities like `nodetool`, `cqlsh`, and `sstableloader` to simplify the process of creating snapshots and moving them between hosts.  A convenient compressed tar archive is generated by `getSnapshot`, and includes all of the SSTable snapshot files, metadata, and schema information necessary to restore the keyspace into another Cassandra cluster (or the same cluster).  The `putSnapshot` tool is then used to alter various attributes of the original snapshot, and restore into the destination Cassandra cluster.

### Features
* Automatically generates a keyspace snapshot and packages into an easy-to-move archive
* Copies snapshots out of the Cassandra data directory, allowing space to be reclaimed using `nodetool clearsnapshot`
* Archive a previously created snapshot (e.g. created manually using `nodetool snapshot`)
* Schedulable using Cron (e.g. for scheduled backups)
* Change keyspace name, datacenter name and replication factor on restore
* Restore to local or remote clusters, either privately hosted or through hosted services like [Datascale.io](http://datascale.io)
* Easy to use with sane defaults
* Most Cassandra versions supported (tested against Cassandra 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, and 3.7)

### Usage
#### getSnapshot

    ```sh
    Usage: ./getSnapshot -h
           ./getSnapshot -k <keyspace name> [-s <snapshot name>] [-y <cassandra.yaml file>] [--no-timestamp]
        -h,--help                          Print usage and exit
        -v,--version                       Print version information and exit
        -k,--keyspace <keyspace name>      REQUIRED: The name of the keyspace to snapshot
        -s,--snapshot <snapshot name>      The name of an existing snapshot to package
        -y,--yaml <cassandra.yaml file>    Alternate cassandra.yaml file
        --no-timestamp                     Don't include a timestamp in the resulting filename
    ```

#### putSnapshot

    ```sh
    Usage: ./putSnapshot -h
           ./putSnapshot -f <snapshot file> [-n <node address>] [-k <new ks name>] [-d <new dc name>] [-r <new rf>] [-y <cassandra.yaml file>]
        -h,--help                          Print usage and exit
        -v,--version                       Print version information and exit
        -f,--file <snapshot file>          REQUIRED: The snapshot file name (created using the
                                           getSnapshot utility
        -n,--node <node address>           Destination Cassandra node IP (defaults to the local
                                           Cassandra IP if run on a Cassandra node, otherwise
                                           required in order to connect to Cassandra.  Will take
                                           precedence if provided and run on a Cassandra node
        -k,--keyspace <new ks name>        Override the destination keyspace name (defaults to
                                           the source keyspace name)
        -d,--datacenter <new dc name>      Override the destination datacenter name (defaults
                                           to the sourcen datacenter name)
        -r,--replication <new rf>          Override the destination replication factor (defaults
                                           to source replication factor)
        -y,--yaml <cassandra.yaml file>    Alternate cassandra.yaml file
    ```

### Basic Examples
1. Copy a keyspace to the same Cassandra cluster using a different keyspace name:

    ```sh
    $ getSnapshot -k <keyspace name>
    $ putSnapshot -f <snapshot package file> -k <new keyspace name>
    ```
2. Copy a keyspace to a remote Cassandra cluster using the same keyspace name:

    ```sh
    $ getSnapshot -k <keyspace name>
    $ putSnapshot -f <snapshot package file> -n <destination node IP>
    ```
3. Copy a keyspace from a Cassandra cluster to a remote cluster using a different keyspace name and replication factor:

    ```sh
    $ getSnapshot -k <keyspace name>
    $ putSnapshot -f <snapshot package file> -n <destination node IP> -k <new keyspace name> -r 1
    ```
4. Copy a snapshot previously created using `nodetool snapshot` to a new keyspace:

    ```sh
    $ nodetool snapshot <keyspace name> -t <custom snapshot name>
    $ getSnapshot -k <keyspace name> -s <custom snapshot name>
    $ putSnapshot -f <snapshot package file> -k <new keyspace name>
    ```

### Caveats
* Currently supports snapshots/restores between clusters running similar versions of Cassandra.
* Partitioner configuration (e.g. RandomPartitioner, Murmur3Partitioner, etc.) must be the same between source and destination Cassandra clusters.
* Local access to the source Cassandra node is required (to create/collect snapshot files).  Fairly open network access is required to the destination Cassandra node (to create the schema and load SSTables).
